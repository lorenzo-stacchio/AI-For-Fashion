## Project idea

The consumer-to-shop task, is a known and hard-to-solve task in the context of Artificial Intelligence for fashion [1];

It consist in recognizing the exact fashion item wear by a person in an everyday context, retrieving pictures of people wearing it in a professional setting (models for e-commerce site, fashion shows...).

Solving this task, would impact in the fashion field from a several perspectives (e.g., e-commerce, marketing analysis, design).

Despite the growing interest on this topic [2,3,4,5], there is a lot of work to do to achieve high enough performances;

We are not here to solve one of the most difficult Computer Vision problems in the field of fashion, but to provide a little contribution analyzing how well-known deep learning models (CNNs), available on Orange, are good to catch visual similarities in such a context;

## Project goals

- (a) Create a small consumer-to-shop dataset, considering pictures depicting you wearing some cloth items and pictures (downloaded from professional e-commerce) of professional models wearing the same item!
- (b) Analyzing those group of images with Orange, firstly extracting features adopting one of the available CNNs and using them to carry out a Hierarchical clustring, as unsupervised machine learning techniques;
- (c) Finally, create a presentation in which you describe the obtained results and pose the basis for a qualitative analysis that could explain the visual similarities found by the adopted deep learning model.
